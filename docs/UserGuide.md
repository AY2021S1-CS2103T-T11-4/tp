‚ö†Ô∏è | This sybmol indicates that there is something important for you to take note of.
üìï | This symbol indicates that there is additional information you may find useful.
‚úèÔ∏è | This symbol indicates that an example is provided.
‚ùó| This symbol indicates that the parameter is required.
‚ùï| This symbol indicates that the parameter is optional.

### 2.2. Format
(Contributed by Yu Ming)

This section shows the format of all the commands in the user guide.

Format | Meaning | Exmaple 
-------| ------------ | ----
`lower_case/` | **Prefixes** | `n/` `p/` `t/`
`UPPER_CASE` | **Parameters** | `NAME` `THRESHOLD` `PRICE`
`[UPPER_CASE]` | **Optional parameters** | `[p/THRESHOLD]` in create budget command

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefixes **cannot have spaces**: `n /` will be an invalid prefix.
>
> üìï Parameters can be in **any order** if they have **prefixes**.

For example, a create budget command can have `n/NAME` and `p/THRESHOLD`, you can specify them in any order:
 - `create n/Temasek Hall Student Council p/1200`, or
 - `create p/1200 n/Temasek Hall Student Council`
 
However, if a given command has any parameter **without prefix**, that given parameter **must** be the **first parameter**.

For example, a edit budget command have an `INDEX`, a `n/NAME` and a `p/THRESHOLD`. In this case, `INDEX` **must** be
the **first parameter**:
 - `edit 1 n/NUS Computing Club p/1000` is a valid command, however
 - `edit n/NUS Computing Club p/1000 1` is an invalid command

### 2.3. Parameters
