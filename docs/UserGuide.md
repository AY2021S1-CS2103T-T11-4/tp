This section shows the format of all the commands in the user guide.

Format | Meaning | Exmaple 
-------| ------------ | ----
`lower_case/` | **Prefixes** | `n/` `p/` `t/` <br/> ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefixes **cannot have spaces**: `n /` will be an invalid prefix| 
`UPPER_CASE` | **Parameters** | `NAME` `THRESHOLD` `PRICE`
`[UPPER_CASE]` | **Optional parameters** | `[p/THRESHOLD]` in create budget command

üìï Note: Parameters can be in **any order** if they have **prefixes**.

For example, a create budget command can have `n/NAME` and `p/THRESHOLD`, you can specify them in any order:

the **first parameter**:
 - `edit 1 n/NUS Computing Club p/1000` is a valid command, however
