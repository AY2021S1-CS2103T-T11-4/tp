## 1. Introduction
NUSave is a budgeting tool made for **students staying on campus** who want to be able to track and manage their own
expenditures with ease. As students, it is common for them to have limited income during their academic years.
Therefore, it is especially necessary for those living independently to plan their finances prudently to ensure that
they do not overspend their tight budget.

A typical student staying on campus has to keep track of: 
* daily expenses
* club finances
* project budgets
* administrative fees

Rather than having multiple documents and spreadsheets to keep track of their budgets, NUSave allows students to
conveniently manage all their expenditures under one centralised platform.

NUSave implements both **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.
In other words, users interact with the application through the command line and the GUI will reflect their actions.

## 2. Setting Up
Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## 3. Design

### 3.1. Architecture
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of each component:

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`] and [`MainApp`].
It has two primary responsibilities:
* At launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the application consists of five components:

1. [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Handles the UI of the application.
1. [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes the commands.
1. [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
1. [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
1. [**`State`**](#state-componenet): Remembers the current state of the application.

For each of the five components:

* Its API is defined in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Its functionality is exposed using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class which implements the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.
    - For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
    using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

The ***Class Diagram*** given above shows how the five components interact with each other.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The ***Sequence Diagram*** given above shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `delete 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component:

### 3.2. Components

#### 3.2.1. UI Component
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API**: `Ui.java`

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

#### 3.2.2. Logic Component
![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API**: `Logic.java`

`Logic` uses the `PageParser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object which is
executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an expenditure). The result of
the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`. In addition, the
`CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteBudgetCommand_sequence_diagram.png)

The ***Sequence Diagram*** given above represents the interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("delete 1")` API call.

#### 3.2.3. Model Component
(Contributed by Chin Hui)
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
Figure 3.4.1: Structure of the model component.

**API** : `Model.java`

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* Stores a `Nusave` object that encapsulates `Budget` and `Expenditure` data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `FilteredList<Renderable>` 
that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so
that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.
* `FilteredList` was used in favor of `ObservableList` to facilitate the find command implementation.
Now the list can be filtered based on a `Predicate`, allowing for more flexibility for other 
filtering extensions i.e. filter by number of expenditures.

The `Nusave`:

* Implements methods that interface with the `Budget` and `Expenditure` 
data following the "Tell, Don't Ask" Principle.
* Stores an `ObservableList<Renderable>` that is passed up to populate the `FilteredList<Renderable>`.
* Stores a `BudgetList` (wrapper class for a `List<Budget>`) as well to access `Expenditures` within a `Budget` since
`Expenditures` cannot be accessed through `ObservableList<Renderable>`.

The `Budget`:
* Implements the Renderable interface and can thus be stored in the FilteredList.
* Contains a `Name`, `Date`, `Optional<Threshold>` and a `List<Expenditure>`.

The `Expenditure`:
* Implements the Renderable interface and can thus be stored in the FilteredList.
* Contains a `Name`, `Date`, `Price` and `Set<Tag>`.

#### 3.2.4. State Component
 (Contributed by Song Yu)
 
 ***API***: `State.java`
 
 The `State` component:
 * Stores a `BudgetIndex` instance that represents the budget that `NUSave` is currently displaying.
 * Stores a `Page` enumeration that represents the type of `Page` NUSave is currently on. 
 * Stores a `BooleanProperty` instance that triggers a callback on change of `boolean` value, updating the page title 
 of the current page.
 *  Stores a `String` value which represents the title of the current page.
 
 `State` is used by `Model` to track the current state of NUSave. When a command that requires a different budget book
 or list of budgets to be displayed is called, `State` will store information of the new page being displayed. This information
 will be used when different commands are entered which requires `model` to know the current `state` of NUSave.
 
 Using the current `Page` of NUSave, commands are parsed separately by either `BudgetPageParser` or `MainPageParser`. 
 Thus, commands with similar names but belonging to different parsers will have different implementations and classes.
 For example, a command like `list` will have different implementations, as a `ListExpenditureCommand` 
 or `ListBudgetCommand.`
 
 ![Structure of the storage component](images/StateClassDiagram.png)
 
 Figure 3.5.1: Structure of the state component.
 

#### 3.2.5. Storage Component
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

**API** : `Storage.java`

The `Storage` component:
* Can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* Can save all NUSave data in JSON format and read it back.

![Structure of the storage component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

Figure 3.6.1: Structure of the storage component.

The `Storage` component uses the Jackson API to convert Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) into JSON files which are then
stored locally. It uses the same API to read existing JSON files during the launch of the application to load the stored
data into `NUSave`. As seen in Figure 3.6.1, `JsonUserPrefsStorage` is responsible for the reading and writing of
`UserPref` objects and contains the file path of its JSON file while `JsonNusaveStorage` is responsible for the
reading and writing of all NUSave data and contains the file path of its JSON file.

![Structure of the data stored by NUSave](images/PojoClassDiagram.png)

Figure 3.6.2: Structure of the data stored by NUSave.

In order for them to be recognised by the Jackson API, NUSave data objects (such as `Budget` and `Expenditure`) must be
converted into POJOs. Figure 3.6.2 depicts how the respective POJO classes for each of the data objects interact with
one another.

##### 4.3.1.1. Create Budget
(Contributed by Yu Ming)

The following Sequence Diagram shows the interaction between the `Logic` component and `Model` component of NUSave 
depicting a scenario when the user wants to create a budget for his Temasek Hall basketball CCA by entering the command
`create n/Temasek Hall Basketball p/100`.

![CreateBudgetCommand Sequence Diagram](diagrams/commandsPlantUML/diagram/CreateBudgetCommand.png) 

Figure 4.1.1.1: Sequence diagram  for create budget command in main page view.

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `MainPageParser` to parse the given user input.
2. The `MainPageParser` will identify the command given by the user and pass the user input down to the
`CreateBudgetCommandParser`.
3. The `CreateBudgetCommandParser` will create a `Budget` with the given parameters **name** and **threshold** from the
user input.
4. The `CreateBudgetCommandParser` will then create a `CreateBudgetCommand` object with the created `Budget` object as
the input parameter.
5. The `CreateBudgetCommandParser` will then return a `CreateBudgetCommand` object.
6. `LogicManager` will now call the `execute` method in the `CreateBudgetCommand` object.
7. The `CreateBudgetCommand` will now call the `addBudget` method of the existing `Model` object and add the `Budget`
object created into NUSave.
8. The `CreateBudgetCommand` then returns a `CommandResult` indicating the successful addition of the `Budget` object.

With the above sequence, a budget will be successfully created by the user in his NUSave application, and it will be
reflected on the user interface.

##### 4.3.1.2. Add Expenditure

#### 4.3.2. Delete Commands

##### 4.3.2.1. Delete Budget
(Contributed by David)

This section explains the `Delete Budget Command`.

The following command results in the specified budget of the particular index to be removed from NUSave. This command
therefore requires a compulsory index to specify the particular budget to be removed.

Only when the index is valid (within the range of existing budgets), does the command execute successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components of NUSave,
depicting a scenario where the user would like to delete the first budget on his list.


![DeleteBudgetCommand Sequence Diagram](diagrams/commandsPlantUML/diagram/DeleteBudgetCommand.png) 

Figure 4.1.2.1: Sequence diagram  for delete budget command in main page view.

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `MainPageParser` to parse the given user input.
2. The `MainPageParser` will identify the command given by the user and pass the user input down to the
`DeleteBudgetCommandParser`.
3. The `DeleteBudgetCommandParser` will create a `BudgetIndex` with the given parameters **index**  from the
user input.
4. The `DeleteBudgetCommandParser` will then create a `DeleteBudgetCommand` object with the created `BudgetIndex`
object as the input parameter.
5. The `DeleteBudgetCommandParser` will then return a `DeleteBudgetCommand` object back to the `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` will now call the `execute` method in the `DeleteBudgetCommand` object, with the `Model` as a 
parameter.
7. The `DeleteBudgetCommand`'s `execute` method will now call the `deleteBudget` method of the existing `Model` object
passed in and delete the `Budget` object within NUSave.
8. The `DeleteBudgetCommand` then returns a `CommandResult` indicating the successful deletion of the `Budget` object.

With the above sequence, a budget will be successfully deleted by the user in his NUSave application, and it will be
reflected on the user interface through the successful `CommandResult` and updated budget list.

##### 4.3.2.2. Delete Expenditure

#### 4.3.3. Edit Commands

##### 4.3.3.1. Edit Budget

##### 4.3.3.2. Edit Expenditure
(Contributed by David)

This section explains the `Edit Expenditure Command`.

The following command results in the specified expenditure of the particular index to be edited within the Budget. 
As such, this command requires a compulsory index to specify the particular expenditure, along with a field at which 
the user would like to edit.

Only when the index is valid (within the range of existing expenditures), and the user provides at least one field to 
be edited, does the command execute successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components of NUSave,
depicting a scenario where the user would like to edit the first expenditure on his/her list, and change the `NAME`,
`PRICE` and `TAG` to `Basketball`, `50` and `Ball` accordingly.

#### 4.3.4. Sort Commands

#### 4.3.5. Find & List Commands

#### 4.3.6. Universal Commands

### 4.4. UI

#### 4.4.1. List View Rendering
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

The List View UI component is able to display both budgets and expenditures through the `Renderable` interface.
Both `Budget` and `Expenditure` classes implements the `Renderable` interface.
As such, `Budget` and `Expenditure` objects can be added to the `ObservableList` of `Renderable` which the List View is binded to.
Whenever changes are made to the `ObservableList`, the List View generates either a `BudgetCard` or `ExpenditureCard` depending on the runtime type of the `Renderable` object.

Repopulation of the List View occurs when:
* the user opens or close a budget.
* the user makes changes to a budget or an expenditure.
